# Docs Intro

Welcome to the Chronicle Protocol documentation!

This documentation covers how to run a validator as part of the Chronicle Protocol oracle network. Running a validator is a great way to contribute to the network.

Oracles are used to bring real-world data to smart contracts. By running a validator, you are helping to make smart contracts more powerful and versatile.
