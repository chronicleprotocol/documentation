 # Verified Asset Oracle Dashboard

The Verified Asset Oracle Dashboard enables users to visualize data verified by Chronicle's Verified Asset Oracle. It provides insights into key financial metrics associated with verified assets, including Net Asset Value per Share (NAV/S), Assets Under Management (AUM), custodian information, and more.

This dashboard is designed to enhance transparency and trust in onchain representations of real-world assets by offering a clear visualization of their underlying data.



Users can check asset verifications in the "Latest Oracle Events" section of the dashboard. This includes details about holdings such as security description, units, maturity dates, unit cost, and base market value.

In the "Administration" section, users can access additional insights, including information about the fundâ€™s custodian, auditor, investment manager, and more.
