 # Verified Asset Oracle Dashboard

The Verified Asset Oracle Dashboard enables users to visualize data verified by Chronicle's Verified Asset Oracle. It provides insights into key financial metrics associated with verified assets, including Net Asset Value per Share (NAV/S), Assets Under Management (AUM), custodian information, and more.

This dashboard is designed to enhance transparency and trust in onchain representations of real-world assets by offering a clear visualization of their underlying data.

## Key Concepts

**NAV/S (Net Asset Value per Share)**
The value of a single share, calculated as the total Net Asset Value divided by the total number of shares.

**AUM (Assets Under Management)**
Represents the total market value of all assets managed by the fund.

**TVL (Total Value Locked)**
Calculated as:
TVL = NAV/S * Total Supply
Reflects the total onchain value tied to the asset.

**NAV (Net Asset Value)**
The overall value of the fund, calculated as:
NAV = Assets - Liabilities

**Yield**

Users can check asset verifications in the "Latest Oracle Events" section of the dashboard. This includes details about holdings such as security description, units, maturity dates, unit cost, and base market value.

In the "Administration" section, users can access additional insights, including information about the fundâ€™s custodian, auditor, investment manager, and more.
