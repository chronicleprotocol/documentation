# Products Overview 

## DeFi Oracles
Chronicle provides [DeFi Oracles](../Products/DeFiOracle/DeFiOracle.md) for various types of data, including cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies, yield rates, and more. Chronicle Oracles use a PUSH model. The Oracles proactively deliver data to smart contracts without requiring an explicit request. They automatically update the smart contract with fresh data whenever a specified event or condition is met.
For example, a PUSH oracle can provide real-time price updates at regular intervals (e.g., every X minutes or hours) or trigger updates when price fluctuations exceed a defined threshold.

## Chronicle's Proof of Assets Oracle
 [Proof of Assets](../Products/VerifiedAssetOracle/verifiedAssetOracle.md), formerly known as the Verified Asset Oracle (VAO), securely and transparently verifies the integrity and quality of offchain assets. It then transmits the resulting data onchain, distributing it directly to smart contracts and onchain products.
