# Products Overview 

## PUSH Oracle
[PUSH Oracles](../Products/pushOracle.md) proactively deliver data to smart contracts without requiring an explicit request. They automatically update the smart contract with fresh data whenever a specified event or condition is met.
For instance, a PUSH oracle can provide real-time price updates at regular intervals (e.g: every x minutes/hours), or trigger updates whenever price fluctuations exceed a defined threshold.

## Chronicle's Verified Asset Oracle
The [Verified Asset Oracle (VAO)](../Products/verifiedAssetOracle.md), formerly known as the RWA Oracle, securely and transparently verifies the integrity and quality of offchain assets. It then transmits the resulting data onchain, distributing it directly to smart contracts and onchain products.

## Chronicle's Yield Rate Oracle
[Chronicle's Yield Rate Oracle](../Products/yieldRateOracle.md) tracks and delivers the value of ETH staking yields onchain, enabling a safe and automated way to customize the interest rate of ETH and ETH-backed derivatives.
