# Chronicle's Verified Asset Oracle (VAO)
## What is Chronicle's Verified Asset Oracle (VAO)?
The Verified Asset Oracle (VAO) delivers cryptographically signed data onchain for tokenized assets, ensuring each asset reflects accurate, real-world value with  transparency and verifiable provenance.

## Who has integrated Chronicle's VAO?
Chronicle’s VAO launched with an initial integration by M0. Additionally, Chronicle powers the winning projects of Spark’s $1 billion Tokenization Grand Prix: [Superstate, Centrifuge, and BlackRock’s BUIDL](https://chroniclelabs.org/blog/chronicle-powers-grand-prix-winners-with-innovative-verified-asset-oracle-technology)

## How does the data get updated?

Chronicle connects directly to the custodian to verify the amount of the underlying asset for the tokenized asset. It verifies offchain creditworthiness and provides key data such as purchase dates, yields, and maturity dates, while syncing the asset lifecycle onchain for events such as issuance, transfer, and settlement.

## What data can the VAO transport?

The VAO can securely and transparently verify the integrity of a wide range of offchain assets, including:

   - Custodied collateral balances
   - Fiat reserves
   - Fund audits and NAV reports
   - Redemption and minting activity
   - Exchange reserves

It then transports the verified data onchain and delivers it directly to smart contracts or other onchain applications.

## Is the VAO suitable for institutional use?
Yes. Chronicle works closely with integration partners to ensure each deployment aligns with their data privacy, legal, and operational requirements.
