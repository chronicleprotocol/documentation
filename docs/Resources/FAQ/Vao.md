# Chronicle's Proof of Asset 
## What is Chronicle's Proof of Asset Oracle?
Proof of Asset delivers cryptographically signed data onchain for tokenized assets, ensuring each asset reflects accurate, real-world value with transparency and verifiable provenance.

## Who has integrated Chronicle's Proof of Asset?
Powering Onchain Asset Innovation: Chronicle’s Proof of Asset launched with an [initial integration with M0](https://chroniclelabs.org/dashboard/vao/m-by-m0) and now underpins some of the most prominent initiatives in real-world asset tokenization. This includes the [Janus Henderson Anemoy Treasury Fund from Centrifuge](https://chroniclelabs.org/dashboard/vao/janus-henderson-anemoy-treasury-fund), the [Superstate Short Duration US Government Securities Fund](https://chroniclelabs.org/dashboard/vao/superstate-ustb), and [Grove’s $1B commitment to a tokenized asset strategy](https://chroniclelabs.org/blog/chronicle-named-exclusive-oracle-partner-to-grove-enabling-a-new-era-of-onchain-credit).

Chronicle also powers the winning projects of Spark’s $1B Tokenization Grand Prix: [Superstate, Centrifuge, and BlackRock’s BUIDL](https://chroniclelabs.org/blog/chronicle-powers-grand-prix-winners-with-innovative-verified-asset-oracle-technology).

## How does the data get updated?

Chronicle connects directly to the custodian to verify the amount of the underlying asset for the tokenized asset. It verifies offchain creditworthiness and provides key data such as purchase dates, yields, and maturity dates, while syncing the asset lifecycle onchain for events such as issuance, transfer, and settlement.

## What data can Proof of Asset transport?

Proof of Asset can securely and transparently verify the integrity of a wide range of offchain assets, including:

   - Custodied collateral balances
   - Fiat reserves
   - Fund audits and NAV reports
   - Redemption and minting activity
   - Exchange reserves

It then transports the verified data onchain and delivers it directly to smart contracts or other onchain applications.

## Is Proof of Asset suitable for institutional use?
Yes. Chronicle works closely with integration partners to ensure each deployment aligns with their data privacy, legal, and operational requirements.
