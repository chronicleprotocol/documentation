# Chronicle's Proof of Assets Dashboard

## What is the Proof of Assets Dashboard?
The [Proof of Assets Dashboard](https://chroniclelabs.org/dashboard/vaos) is the visualization layer of Proof of Assets Oracle. It transforms cryptographic attestations about tokenized asset reserves into clear, transparent, and verifiable insights that anyone can inspect.

## What information can I see in the Proof of Assets Dashboard?

The Dashboard provides a full lifecycle view of tokenized assets, including:
- Administration: custodians, auditors, and legal structures
- Token Supply: ERC20 contracts and minting activity across chains
- Holdings: underlying assets contributing to NAV
- Onchain Activity: issuance, approvals, and other onchain interactions.

## Who benefits from the Proof of Assets Dashboard?

- Institutions: gain stronger compliance tools and transparent audit trails for regulators or LPs
- DeFi builders: can confidently integrate verified data feeds into their protocols
- Ecosystem participants: get confidence that reported reserves and NAV are trustworthy and tamper-proof.

## What makes the Proof of Assets Dashboard different from other RWA dashboards?
While most RWA dashboards depend on secondary market issuers for reported values, the Proof of Assets Dashboard provides true end-to-end verifiability by sourcing data directly from custodians and publishing cryptographic attestations that anyone can independently verify.
