# Offchain Components

     - **Validators** (aka Feeds) interact with the peer-to-peer Validator network to read and write messages, and they also read data from relays. Validators process this raw data into usable information using different Data Models, transforming it into Chronicle data (prices for different asset pairs). Once calculated, this data is signed and sent to the peer-to-peer network.


    - **Challenger** is an offchain component that listens to Oracleâ€™s updates and makes sure that no invalid optimistic update is made. Thus we can be sure that our Optimistic Oracles are functioning properly. Both challengers and relays are permissionless jobs with challengers even getting paid for their effort. Participation from the community is both encouraged and supported.

    - **Origins** are the data sources about the asset prices that can exist on-chain (DEX) such as UniSwap, dYdX, Balancer, etc. or be offchain from CEXs ( e.g. Kraken, Binance, Coinbase).


    - **Relays**  actively listen to the peer-to-peer network (the Transport Layer) and create EVM transactions out of these messages. Subsequently, these EVM transactions are recorded onchain.


    - **Archiver** aggregates the messages created by Validators and stores it in a database. It collect all signed messages, not the intermediate messages like used for MuSig creating.

    - **Dashboard**:  The [chroniclelabs.org](https://chroniclelabs.org/dashboard) queries the archiver to present the prices on its dashboard. You can find all of our current Oracles [here](https://chroniclelabs.org/dashboard/oracles)

    You can find your token name by using the search box or by selecting your preferred blockchain from the filter located in the top-right corner (see Figure below).
