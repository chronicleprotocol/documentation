# Chronicle RWA Oracle

## What are RWAs?

In the context of blockchain, Real-World Assets (RWAs) refer to physical assets and traditional financial instruments represented as digital assets on a blockchain network. These assets can range from assets such as real estate, commodities, art, and even intellectual property, to financial assets such as bonds, stocks, or ETFs. RWAs provide a bridge between traditional and decentralized finance opening up new opportunities for market inclusion, accessibility, and innovation.

## Chronile Protocol Initial RWA Integration with M^0

In August 2024, Chronicle launched a Real World Asset (RWA) Oracle with an integration with [M^0](https://www.m0.org/), a decentralized onchain protocol, as well as a set of off-chain standards and APIs, that allows multiple Minters to issue a fully fungible cryptodollar called $M.

Chronicle Protocol onboarded as a validator, providing onchain information on the presence of offchain collateral (currently short term T-bills) used by Minters to generate $M. To learn more about this collaboration, please refer to the following [article](https://chroniclelabs.org/blog/m-0-and-chronicle-raising-the-standard-in-collateral-verification-with-the-rwa-oracle).
