# Chronicle's Validator Set


Validators are the backbone of the Chronicle Protocol, maintaining the decentralized infrastructure that powers the oracle network. Their responsibilities include:

- Collecting data from diverse sources (onchain and offchain).
- Aggregating inputs to ensure accuracy.
- Submitting final values onchain in a secure, verifiable manner.

By participating in this distributed network, validators enhance the protocol’s security, reliability, and resilience.

## What Makes Chronicle Different

Chronicle's validator set is composed of reputable, battle-tested organizations across Web3.

This approach ensures that:
- Validators are aligned with the long-term success of Web3.
- They are resilient to coercion and capable of maintaining service under pressure.
- They bring deep expertise and proven security practices, ensuring reliable onchain data flows.
- Each new validator strengthens the network’s resilience while contributing unique expertise.
