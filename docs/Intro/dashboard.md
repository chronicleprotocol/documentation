# The Chronicle Dashboard
The [Chronicle Dashboard](https://chroniclelabs.org/dashboard) enables full transparency over where the Oracle-reported data was sourced and who reported/signed it.

## Where is the data sourced from?

Using the dashboard, users can select a time interval on the graph and, for each validator, use the drop-down arrow to see the different data sources that have been used. Typically, the data sources are a mix of on-chain and off-chain data sources with high liquidity.

    src="/img/Intro/time.png"
    alt="Check Sources"
    width="500"

</div>

    alt="Check Sources"
    width="500"
/>
</div>
In addition, users can cryptographically verify in the browser that the validator's signature has not been tampered with.

    alt="Check Sources"
    width="500"
/>
</div>

Modifying even one character of the signature will result in invalidating the signature.
