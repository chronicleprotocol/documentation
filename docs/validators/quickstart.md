# Quickstart

:::info

Chronicle operates a distributed network of validators run by reputable projects in the space, including MakerDAO/Sky, Etherscan, Gnosis, Bitcoin Suisse, and others. This structure reinforces both security and decentralization, setting Chronicle apart from other oracle solutions.

**Note: Running a validator is a permissioned process.** This documentation is intended for projects that have already been approved to run a validator.
:::

A single script installation from baremetal to running validator, using k3s.

### Helm Chart details:

This documentation covers how to run a validator as part of the Chronicle Protocol oracle network. Running a validator is a great way to contribute to the network.

Oracles are used to bring real-world data to smart contracts. By running a validator, you are helping to make smart contracts more powerful and versatile.

This will run a complete end-to-end installation required for running a Chronicle Validator.

It will attempt to install:

* [k3s](https://docs.k3s.io/installation)
* [Helm v3](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
* Generate `generated-values.yaml` needed to install the [`chronicle/validator`](https://github.com/chronicleprotocol/charts/tree/main/charts/validator) helm chart
* A tor daemon will be deployed using a [tor-controller](https://github.com/chronicleprotocol/charts/blob/main/charts/validator/crds/tor-controller.yaml), which install some custom resource definitions. This is a requirement for the `WEB_API` transport layer which sends validator messages over tor networks. 


## Requirements:

* Ubuntu 22.04 / Ubuntu 23.04 / Ubuntu 24.04
* 2Gb RAM
* 20Gb storage
* Server needs to be deployed into a public subnet (ie have a public IP)
* [â€‹](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/requirements#inbound-rules-for-k3s-server-nodes)At **LEAST** ports the following ports must be accessible from the internet:

| Protocol | Port | Description |
|----------|------|----------------|
| TCP     | 6443  | K3s supervisor and Kubernetes API Server |
| TCP     | 8000  | chronicle/ghost |
| TCP     | 8001  | chronicle/ghost-vao |
| UDP     | 8472  | Required for Flannel VXLAN |

* Optional ports that need to be open:

| Protocol | Port | Description |
|----------|------|----------------|
| TCP     | 10250 | Kubelet metrics |
| SSH     | 22    | SSH access to the host |

:::caution
This installation process assumes you have a fresh bare-bones ubuntu instance/VPS. If you need simple VPS hosting, we suggest using a provider like [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com/), and spinning up a droplet, or [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/ec2/) instance provided its in a public subnet. [Linode](https://www.vultr.com/), [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/), [OVH](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/) etc are also great providers.
:::

***

## Deploy using `install.sh`

The script is interactive and will prompt you for some required information

### Before you start:

You will need to provide the following:

* a feed name (eg `my-feed`)
* the path to your ETH `keystore` file (eg `/path/to/keys/keystore.json` needs to exist on the server)
* the path to your keystore password file (eg `/path/to/password.txt` needs to exist on the server. An empty password file is still needed if wallet is not encrypted. eg `touch password.txt`)
* the corresponding ETH from address (eg `0x123....`)
* An Ethereum Mainnet RPC endpoint (including protocol, eg https://my-eth-rpc.domain.com

:::tip
Managed RPC providers can become costly if they are heavily utilized. We recommend that you use spin up your own dedicated ETH node for cost management.
:::

There are alternative RPC providers that you can use as well which aim to be as decentralized as possible:

- [https://drpc.org](https://drpc.org/)
- [https://www.nodies.app](https://www.nodies.app)
- [https://www.grove.city](https://www.grove.city)
- [https://blastapi.io](https://blastapi.io)
- [https://ankr.com](https://ankr.com)
- [https://www.dwellir.com/](https://www.dwellir.com/)z


#### Some DIY approaches:

- [https://dappnode.com/](https://dappnode.com/)
- [ethpandaops/ethereum](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-helm-charts/tree/master/charts/ethereum-node) (helm chart, requires beacon)
- [chronicle/ethereum](https://github.com/chronicleprotocol/charts/tree/main/charts/ethereum) (helm chart, requires [beacon](https://github.com/chronicleprotocol/charts/tree/main/charts/beacons))

* this list is not exhaustive, and Chronicle is in no way affiliated with any managed providers, these are just suggestions.

You can provide these variables with `.env` as well Take a look at the `.env` section. The installer will create kubernetes secrets that are used in the helm release and feed services.

### Retrieve the installation script and make it executable

First, ssh to the server:

```ssh 
user@<myhostip>
```

Download the install bash script:

```bash
cd /tmp
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chronicleprotocol/scripts/main/feeds/k3s-install/install.sh 
chmod a+x install.sh
```

This script **must not** be run as root. A user with `sudo` permissions is required. If you execute the script as `root` , you will be prompted if the script should attempt to create a user for you. Follow the prompts if you require a new user.

```bash
root@local:/tmp# ./install.sh 
[INFO]:..........running preflight checks.........
[ERROR]: This script should not be run as root!
Would you like to create a new user to run this script? (y/n)
```

When a user is added to the `sudo` group, it usually needs to log out and log back in for the group changes to take effect.

To resolve this, you can either:

1. Log out and log back in with the new user and then run the script again.
2. Or, you can switch to the new user using `su - <username>` after creating the user, which simulates a login and should recognize the new group assignment.

However, if you are already doing this and still facing the issue, it might be due to the `sudo` command requiring a password and there is no password set for the new user.

### Execute the script

```bash
su - <username>
ubuntu@local:/tmp$ ./install.sh
```

Complete output from the installer should look something like below (some bloat has been omitted for brevity/legibility):

```bash
ubuntu@local:/tmp$ ./install.sh 
[INFO]:..........running preflight checks.........

```

Once the installation is completed, you can retrieve your tor onion address using this command:

```bash
kubectl get onion -n $NAME_SPACE
```
where `$NAME_SPACE` is the namespace where you deployed your validator in.

> Please provide the `ETH_FROM` and `TOR onion` address to the Chronicle team so it can be whitelisted to receive `WEB_API` traffic.

:::tip
The install script can be run multiple times with the same values. It will attempt to run `helm upgrade <feedname> -n <feedname> chronicle/validator` on your feed release, with any updated input variables. **Note**: it will delete secrets in an existing namespace, and recreate them as, secrets are generally immutable

#### View pod logs:

```bash
kubectl logs -n demo deployment/ghost
kubectl logs -n demo deployment/ghost-vao
```

Make sure that the `EXTERNAL-IP` shown for the `ghost` service, matches your server's IP address.

### Install with \`.env\`

The script will look for a `.env` file in the same directory level as `install.sh`. This file can be used to populate the required input values:

```bash
cat .env
# -- Name of the feed (will create a director and helm release based off this name)
# -- NB: this name must be unique across all feeds, and name must be lowercase.
FEED_NAME=myfeedname

# -- ETH address related to ETHPASS and ETH_KEYSTORE
ETH_FROM=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
ETH_PASSWORD=/root/password.txt
ETH_KEYSTORE=/root/keystore.json

# -- HTTP rpc endpoint for ETH mainnet - NB include the protocol (http/https)
ETH_RPC_URL='https://my-eth-rpc.com'

# -- Public IP address of the server (needed for lib2p networking)
# the installer script will attempt to resolve this for you, if you have issues, try setting it manually below to an IP address that will resolve to your server
# NODE_EXT_IP='127.0.0.1'

# -- override the default (warning) logLevel by setting this to one of `debug, info, warning, error`
#LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

If the script fails to find any of these values, it will prompt you for them when running the script.

***

## Installing via helm (manually)

Make sure the `chronicle` helm repository has been added:

```bash
helm repo add chronicle https://chronicleprotocol.github.io/charts/
helm repo update
```

```bash
export $VALIDATOR_NAME
ubuntu@local:/tmp$ helm repo list
NAME     	URL                                        
chronicle	https://chronicleprotocol.github.io/charts/

helm install $VALIDATOR_NAME -f /home/chronicle/$VALIDATOR_NAME/generated-values.yaml -n $VALIDATOR_NAME chronicle/validator --version 0.4.3
```

the installer will create `generated-values.yaml` which contains the configuration needed to deploy the helm feed. you can inspect the file, located in the `$HOME/$VALIDATOR_NAME`directory. Or you can create your own `values.yaml` file populated with config as show below:

```bash
global:
  logLevel: "debug"

ghost:
  ethConfig:
    ethFrom:
      existingSecret: 'demo-eth-keys'
      key: "ethFrom"
    ethKeys:
      existingSecret: 'demo-eth-keys'
      key: "ethKeyStore"
    ethPass:
      existingSecret: 'demo-eth-keys'
      key: "ethPass"

  env:
    normal:
      CFG_LIBP2P_EXTERNAL_ADDR: '/ip4/64.46.13.31'

  ethRpcUrl: "https://eth.llamarpc.com"
  rpcUrl: "https://eth.llamarpc.com"

vao:
  env:
    normal:
      CFG_LIBP2P_EXTERNAL_ADDR: '/ip4/64.46.13.31'

```

You can view all values available for the [validator chart](https://github.com/chronicleprotocol/charts/blob/main/charts/validator/README.md#values), however the values provided with the installer are enough to get you going.

A useful value to add is `.Values.global.logLevel`as show above. setting `logLevel: debug`will provide more verbose logging and can help you identify issues with the services. Its advised to run the default values (`warning`) once you have your feed stable. Acceptable values are `debug, info, warning, error`

With a valid `values.yaml` file created, you should be able to install a feed:

```bash
helm install $VALIDATOR_NAME \
  --namespace $VALIDATOR_NAME \
  --create-namespace \
  -f path/to/values.yaml \
 chronicle/validator \
 --version 0.4.3
```

or to upgrade an existing helm release:

```bash
helm upgrade $VALIDATOR_NAME \
  --namespace $VALIDATOR_NAME \
  -f path/to/values.yaml \
 chronicle/validator \
 --version 0.4.3
```

:::tip
you can perform a `dry-run` by passing `--debug --dry-run` to the `helm install`` `` ``/ ``helm upgrade`command. This will show you all resources that will be created or modified, and can be useful for catching issues before deploying.
